        <h2>Work Items</h2>
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Areas of active interest over the next few months. This is a brain dump, and a much better way of tracking wtf I want to do than the current todo-list method I’ve been using. I doubt I’ll get half this crap done.</p>
<h2 id="software-as-a-service">Software as a Service</h2>
<p>Some day I would like to have tens of dollars come into my bank account every month. Here are two pieces of software I am writing in the hopes that people will want to pay me:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Writing a SaaS Wiki platform.
    <ul>
      <li>Needs some sort of inline wiki editor. Haven’t looked too hard, and I figure I could write one if need be.</li>
      <li>Need to extend the markdown parser (cebe/markdown) to support lots of extensions useful wiki extensions. Yes, it’s markdown based, and yes, I realize you can use a Github repo/wiki or something instead. Or an existing wiki solution.</li>
      <li>Should probably hire people to audit cebe/markdown for security issues</li>
      <li>I need a better styling than the bullshit I came up with when drunk. Not that it’s bad, but I was drunk.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Writing a SaaS Book Editing tool.
    <ul>
      <li>I originally wrote one to make it easy for me to allow people to edit my own book, and I figure it might be useful to other people.</li>
      <li>Needs to support context for comments</li>
      <li>Missing comment notifications</li>
      <li>No way to currently mark a comment as “resolved”, which makes it a pita to have to review old comments.</li>
      <li>Need to support giving users access to books as well as limiting them to certain chapters. Currently I need to insert a database record, and that won’t work in production.</li>
      <li>Need to support multiple “owners” of a book. Maybe like book organizations or something. Might need to rework the permission system.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fun-side-projects">Fun side projects</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A yes/no domain hosting platform. You point a domain at the yes/no generator, pay $10 a year, and get stats/an api to switch the yes/no to something else.</li>
  <li><a href="http://humanslol.org/">humanslol.org</a> needs to be a thing.</li>
  <li>Making <a href="https://twitter.com/savant/status/520684357946994688">more 8-bit paintings</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="blogging">Blogging</h2>
<ul>
  <li>CakeAdvent 2014 is going to be a thing - <a href="/tags/CakeAdvent-2013/">last year</a> was tres excellent - and I’m currently gathering material</li>
  <li>Bringing back my <a href="/tags/daily-dev-log/">daily dev log</a> in some fashion. It helped me formulate my plans - most work ended up being spread out over a series of a few days.</li>
  <li>A few tutorial posts I started but never completed, plus things people ask about in my issue tracker.</li>
  <li>Writing more tutorials on operations-type things, which will give me an excuse to learn how to use said tools.</li>
  <li>Updates to my blog to make discovering content a bit easier, as well as styling and blah blah fucking blah.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p>I’m writing/rewriting a few books, mostly on CakePHP.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A book on using <a href="http://www.fabfile.org/">Python Fabric</a> for various things.
    <ul>
      <li>Based on some of the things I’ve done at work/to support work.</li>
      <li>Using it as an api, writing custom decorators, integrating with AWS, fixing logging, writing Web UIs, etc. Should be a small but fun one.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Updating my <a href="/cakephp-book/">current CakePHP book</a> to 3.x.
    <ul>
      <li>I’m about half-way done, but need to redo certain chapters as the CakePHP apis change a bit in certain cases.</li>
      <li>Want to also add two new chapters:
        <ul>
          <li>Versioning Pastes</li>
          <li>Adding a simple api with oauth integration</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Converting a tutorial series to CakePHP 3.x.
    <ul>
      <li>The original writer has given me permission, just need to actually write the content.</li>
      <li>Aimed towards intro CakePHP users, so different target from my first one.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="open-source">Open Source</h2>
<p>As always, I’m heavily involved in both my own and community projects. Poop.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://beaver.readthedocs.org/">Beaver</a> needs a whole lot of love :( . I wish I had time to work on it/improve it, as I learned a lot during the process and I know there are things I can improve.</li>
  <li>I started helping maintain <a href="https://github.com/progrium/dokku">Dokku</a> - a single-server heroku alternative.
    <ul>
      <li>The original maintainer was burned out I guess. NBD, shit happens. I think he’s starting to pickup some steam, so hopefully we can continue on with this.</li>
      <li>Lots of pull requests and issues to triage. I closed ~60 issues and merged ~19 pull requests over the past week. My goal is zero bugs by the time we hit our 0.4.0 release, so stabilizing the external api is pretty important.</li>
      <li>I personally made 22 commits over the past few days. It’s been a good way to exercise my bash-fu.</li>
      <li>Tests still fail, and I don’t have access to the webserver that runs them or even the script that handles test-running :( . We’ll get that sorted out though, I’m sure.</li>
      <li>I’d like to write a simple web ui for it and integrate it with AWS services - RDS, ElastiCache, backups - and potentially sell that web ui as a product. Not that anyone would/should buy it. I’ve always wanted to write web tools to automate servers…</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Lots of <a href="/open-source/">CakePHP open source</a>…
    <ul>
      <li>Move <a href="https://github.com/friendsofcake/vagrant-chef">friendsofcake/vagrant-chef</a> to support more of a heroku-style deploy for any PHP framework. Would be extremely nice if users of the project could just have their framework auto-detected and be able to work.</li>
      <li>Work on <a href="https://github.com/friendsofcake/crud-view">friendsofcake/crud-view</a>. I started a while back, but it needs a lot of love and a dedicated developer. It’s basically scaffolding on steroids.</li>
      <li>Updating a bunch of plugins to CakePHP 3.x.</li>
      <li>Marking a bunch of plugins as deprecated and pointing users to alternatives</li>
      <li>Adding support to filter out 3.x from 2.x plugins on the CakePHP plugins site</li>
      <li>Making a new version of the <a href="https://github.com/friendsofcake/app-template/">friendsofcake/app-template</a> project for 3.x. Much simpler now that CakePHP 3 has built-in support for using DSNs for connection strings, but still has to be done at some point. Will be necessary for my book.</li>
      <li>Contributing cli-based migration generation for <a href="https://phinx.org/">phinx</a>. We have r<a href="https://github.com/CakeDC/migrations/blob/master/Docs/Documentation/Generate-Migrations-Without-DB-Interaction.md">ails-like migration generation</a> in CakePHP 2.x, but now that we’re adopting a community library, we need to port that feature. Won’t be hard as the basic structure is already there.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Generic PHP queuing library.
    <ul>
      <li>I already have a version I stopped working on last year called <a href="https://github.com/josegonzalez/php-queuesadilla">php-queuesadilla</a>, though it needs some love and care before it can be considered general use. It also needs to use proper queuing systems (rabbit and zero are missing).</li>
      <li>All the existing ones suck or pull in quite a few requirements.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="work-related-stuff">Work-related stuff</h2>
<p>There’s other, more important crap, but one does not simply post all the things. The stuff here will likely be open source if it already isn’t.</p>
<ul>
  <li>An integration between ruby’s ERB templates and consul. Should let me re-use chef templates rather than needing to maintain them in two places.</li>
  <li>Make it easier to interact with <a href="https://github.com/seatgeek/cronq">cronq</a>, a distributed cron-like system. Also have a few logging improvements to make, and the codebase isn’t the greatest thing…</li>
  <li>Making <a href="https://github.com/seatgeek/graphite-pager">graphite-pager</a> scale slightly better, perhaps by rewriting it to be a statsd clone so that it can introspect on data rather than retreiving it during a check.</li>
  <li>Clean up a php-aqmp job system we have (unrelated to my own open source work). You know, to be good open-source citizens.</li>
</ul>
